# Udacity-Deep-Learning
Projects done for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

NOTE: Please do not use the code for your submissions and commit plagarism. If needed, viewers can use this as a reference.

Project 1:
Here we learn how to construct a Neural Network from scratch (using only numpy for the most part)

Project 2:
Here we learn how to construct your own Convolutional Neural Network model and use Transfer learning for classification.
